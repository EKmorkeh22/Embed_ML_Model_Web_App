# Usage
Here's how you can use the project:

Access the web application at http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
Interact with the ML model through the user-friendly interface with features like the patients : Plasma glucose level,Body mass index,Blood pressure levels etc

# Documentation 
For detailed documentation and API usage, visit http://localhost:8000/docs after running the app locally.

# Dockerization
First create a Dockerfile, check documention : Docker Official Documentation - Dockerfile reference

Dockerize the application with the following commands:

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t app_name-app .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 80:80 app_name-app

# Deployment
The APP was further deployed on huggingface. You can interact with the app via huggingface following the steps below
